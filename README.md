# VathrisProgram
This is a program that I've written to help run game sessions in Vathris, a tabletop RPG game created by Nicholas Hensley (my brother) and I. This program serves three primary purposes:

To automate complex calculations to save time during game sessions.
To digitally store character information (and use this stored information in the gameâ€™s calculations).
To quickly generate enemies with randomized loot.

I first began writing this program in mid-2022. Initially, the purpose of the program was only to automate calculations (the type of calculations that would traditionally involve dice rolls in other tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons). However, as we began playing Vathris again in mid-2023 and development of the game continued, the scope of this program expanded and continues to expand. I plan on doing the following in the near future:

Dividing VathrisProgram.py into multiple .py files, especially in the separation of enemies into a separate file (enemy definitions currently take up about half of the program).
Creating additional automatic calculations, creating a functionality for character inventory transfer, and adding more player characteristics into the program so they can be tracked digitally.
Storing all current items and their information in the program, and updating the program whenever new items are added. This will be so that I do not have to manually input information about items (especially mass) whenever using the program.
Adding the storing and reading of character data (especially inventory) across game sessions. At the moment, character data is manually stored on a Google Doc and needs to be inputted into the program before each game session. This character data will also be updated whenever a change occurs so that users can digitally access their player data in game sessions through a Discord bot (which is a separate program called VathrisDiscordBot).
